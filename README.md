# Blaire's Crafts

When I'm not coding, I make miniature art with polymer clay. Blaire's Crafts is my attempt to incorporate my sculpting and coding skills that I have developed over the years. It is an e-commerce site created with Angular framework with a user-interface that is responsive and scalable. 

## Goal

My goal for this project is basically to prove to everyone(majorly, the voices in my head) that choosing to study daily since February, 2021 wasn't a mistake and that it's possible to achieve anything if we can only dare to dream and act.

## Tools

The tools I used are:

|Tool|Description|
|---|---|
|VS code|IDE|
|Angular version 12.2.11|JavaScript framework|
| Bootstrap, Vanilla CSS and Angular material|Styling|
|Git and GitHub|Version control|
