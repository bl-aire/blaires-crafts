# Blaire's Crafts

When I'm not coding, I make miniature art with polymer clay. Blaire's Crafts is my attempt to incorporate my sculpting and coding skills that I have developed over the years. It is an e-commerce site created with Angular framework with a user-interface that is responsive and scalable. 

## Goal

My goal for this project is basically to prove to everyone(majorly, the voices in my head) that choosing to study daily since February, 2021 wasn't a mistake and that it's possible to achieve anything if we can only dare to dream and act.

## Tools

The tools I used are:
-IDE: VS code
-JavaScript framework: Angular version 12.2.11
-Styling: Bootstap, Vanilla CSS and Angular material
-Version control: Git an GitHub

## User Interface

*In the works*
